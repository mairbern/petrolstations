# petrolstations
AI generated Django app for listing gasstations with fuel prices.

The app was entirely created by the AI. Only minor changes added by me - details below. Gemeni 2.0 Flash, T=1.

I added a time-variable by hand to reflect the latest update of a record. (/petrolstations/models.py and /petrolstations/templates/petrolstations/petrol_station_list.html) 

At some point the AI did add the next steps into the “code window”. It made it a bit harder to read and copy, but it worked out. 

The migration did not work immediately. I just continued and tried again later, and it worked. 

It was fairly easy to follow the step-by-step instructions, but I needed to refer to the Django manual and example to figure out some errors. (Turned out to by typos I had.) 

Without knowing anything about Django I was able to make something. I just have no idea what and how. It was just like building a lego-set by instructions ... easy, but not able to replicate, change or repair myself. 

The app is to record fuel prices at gas stations. The time stamp indicates the latest update, and it has a boolean for electric charging.
